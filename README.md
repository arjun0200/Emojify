# Emojify
This algorithm can detect emoji automatically by checking sentences and words


* In many emoji interfaces, we need to remember that ❤️  is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. 
* In other words, we'll have to remember to type "heart" to find the desired emoji, and typing "love" won't bring up that symbol.
* We can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!
* When using word vectors, we'll see that even if our training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, our algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.
