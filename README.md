# Emojify
This algorithm can detect emoji automatically by checking sentences and words.

There are two methods one is baseline method and another one is using keras to detect emoji through words


* In many emoji interfaces, we need to remember that ❤️  is the "heart" symbol rather than the "love" symbol. 
* In other words, we'll have to remember to type "heart" to find the desired emoji, and typing "love" won't bring up that symbol.
* We can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!
* When using word vectors, we'll see that even if our training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, our algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.
